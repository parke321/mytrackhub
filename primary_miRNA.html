<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tracks are miRNA expression levels of 48 primary cell types and 42 cancer/immortalized cell lines. Cells were generally grown in culture or were flow sorted. Each cell type may
be the average of several similar cells or the data from a single cell line/culture. Data is expressed in reads per million miRNA reads (RPM) through analysis performed through the miRNA
alignment software <a href="http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html">miRge</a>. This data is not otherwise normalized.  A second value, RUV (Remove unwanted variation) is the result of an analysis that normalized across the samples. RUV values 
are lower and have negative (O) values for many miRNAs that are lowly expressed by RPM values.  The data is not log normalized.

</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>Primary cell tracks are colored black and cancer cells tracks are colored red. The data is best viewed with a "pack" configuration and individual sample tracks can be toggled on or off. Clicking
on a given sample will reveal additional information about the sample including the RUV score value.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Process 1</h3>
Data was obtained from the Sequence Read Archive or from primary cells grown in culture.  Fastq files were processed with <a href="http://atlas.pathology.jhu.edu/baras/miRge.html">miRge</a> for 
counting miRNAs. miRNAs were normalized to reads per million miRNA reads (RPM).

<h3>Process 2</h3>
Additional processing was performed with the Remove Unwanted Variation (RUV) method to normalize across samples.

<h3>Notes</h3>
For a full description of the method, please see the methods section of the manuscript below (McCall et al 2017).
